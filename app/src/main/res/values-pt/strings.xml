    <string name="yuan_all_watermark">The most effective way to detect a fake Chinese money is the watermark. Hold the bill up against light, a watermark of Chairman Mao is shown. The watermark on a real 100 Yuan banknote is distinct while the watermark on a fake one is rather obscure.</string>
    <string name="yuan_all_description">The second way to detect a fake Chinese banknote is to scratch the hair of Chairman Mao. You can feel the hair on a real banknote. But on a fake banknote, the hair can not be felt.  \n  \n Another way to detect a fake bill is to see if there is 100, 50, 20 or 10 in the blue circle area when you pivot the banknote horizontally and slowly. </string>

    <string name="pmex_all_watermark">This is an image that is manufactured directly onto the cotton-paper and the polymer substrate and can be seen on both sides of the banknote when placed against the light, with all its details and different tones. \n  \n The watermark on the F type banknotes is an image of the bust-head figure of the note. In the case of the commemorative 200-peso banknote, it is the image of the Winged Victory.  The commemorative 100-peso banknote does not have this security element. \n  \n The 100-, 200-, the commemorative 200-, the 500- and 1000-peso banknotes have an additional watermark which is the image of the denomination number. \n  \n </string>
    <string name="pmex_all_description">This is an image that is manufactured directly onto the cotton-paper and the polymer substrate and can be seen on both sides of the banknote when placed against the light, with all its details and different tones.INTAGLIO AND EMBOSSING PERCEPTIBLE BY TOUCH \n Some features of the banknote’s surface are in raised print (intaglio and/or embossing), which is perceptible by touch, specially the “Banco de México” text, the bust-head figure, the denomination number, the mark for the blind and visually impaired people, and the denomination in letters. Cotton-paper banknotes have intaglio in the color-shifting element and polymer notes have embossing in the clear window. \n  \n In the 20-peso banknote, the intaglio can be felt on the scale of justice; in the 50-peso banknote, on the cannons frame; in the 100-peso banknote, in the seated men; in the 200-peso banknote, on the books, the window and the inkwell; in the 500-peso banknote, on the arum lilies, the paintbrushes and the woman; and in the 1000-peso banknote, on the church and on the bell. The commemorative 100- and 200-peso banknotes also have raised print on the commemorative legend and on the number “2010”. This feature also appears on the diminishing text, in both cotton-paper notes and in the new 50-peso banknote. \n  \n When the banknote is new or has been hardly used, the intaglio and embossing is felt more easily. \n  \n  \n  \n COLOR-SHIFTING ELEMENT \n It is an element that changes color when the banknote is moved or tilted. \n  \n 500-peso banknote \n  \n The color-shifting effect is on the right-hand side of the flower, on the upper left-hand corner of the banknote. This feature is in intaglio, which is perceptible by touch. \n  \n 1000-peso banknote \n  \n The color-shifting effect is on the chapel and on right-hand side tower. This feature is in intaglio which is perceptible by touch. \n  \n  \n  \n  \n 3D-THREAD \n This thread is manufactured directly onto the cotton-paper substrate. It has 3D figures in the form of snails. These figures move in opposite direction to how the banknote is shifted; if the banknote is moved to the sides, the figures move up and down; if the banknote is moved up and down, the figures shift to the sides. \n  \n The 3D-thread is red in the 100-peso banknote, green in the 200-peso banknote, brown in the 500-peso banknote, and violet in the 1000-peso banknote. \n  \n  \n MICROPRINTING \n The front and back microprinting texts which are very small texts, which usually require of a magnifying glass to be read. \n  \n 500-peso banknote \n  \n SE HA DICHO QUE LA REVOLUCIÓN NO NECESITA AL ARTE, PERO QUE EL ARTE NECESITA DE LA REVOLUCIÓN. ESO NO ES CIERTO. LA REVOLUCIÓN SÍ NECESITA UN ARTE REVOLUCIONARIO. \n DIEGO RIVERA. \n  \n 1000-peso banknote \n  \n "... SIN PATRIA NI LIBERTAD ESTAREMOS SIEMPRE A MUCHA DISTANCIA DE LA VERDADERA FELICIDAD" \n GRITO DE DOLORES \n 16 DE SEPTIEMBRE DE 1810 \n  \n  \n SECURITY THREAD \n  \n When holding the 100-, 200-, 500- and 1000-peso banknotes against the light, you can see a thread of approximately one millimeter (width) that crosses the note vertically. This thread is known as security thread and is manufactured directly onto the cotton-paper substrate. \n  \n This feature is detected when holding the banknote against the light. \n  \n  \n  \n FLUORESCENCE \n On the back of the banknotes there are designs printed with fluorescent ink, which glow when placed against ultraviolet light (also known as “black light”). The new 50-peso banknote has two fluorescent inks. \n  \n Fluorescencia en rev billetes F y F1 -inglés \n  \n Cotton paper banknotes they have color fibers on both sides—that is, tiny fibers embedded in the paper and distributed randomly. These fibers are fluorescent and can only be seen under black light. \n  \n In case of 100-, 200-, 500-, and 1000-peso banknotes, the 3D-thread also shines when a banknote is placed under a black light.</string>
    <string name="usd_100_watermark">Hold the note to light and look for a faint image of Benjamin Franklin in the blank space to the right of the portrait. The image is visible from both sides of the note.</string>
    <string name="usd_100_description">3D Security Ribbon \n Tilt the note back and forth while focusing on the blue ribbon. You will see the bells change to 100s as they move. When you tilt the note back and forth, the bells and 100s move side to side. If you tilt it side to side, they move up and down. The ribbon is woven into the paper, not printed on it. \n  \n  \n Color-Shifting Ink \n Tilt the note to see the Bell in the Inkwell and the numeral 100 in the lower right corner of the front of the note shift from copper to green. \n  \n Security Thread \n Hold the note to light to see an embedded thread running vertically to the left of the portrait. The thread is imprinted with the letters USA and the numeral 100 in an alternating pattern and is visible from both sides of the note. The thread glows pink when illuminated by ultraviolet light. \n  \n Raised Printing \n Move your finger up and down Benjamin Franklin’s shoulder on the left side of the note. It should feel rough to the touch, a result of the enhanced intaglio printing process used to create the image. Traditional raised printing can be felt throughout the $100 note, and gives genuine Federal Reserve notes their distinctive texture. \n  \n Microprinting \n Look carefully (magnification may be necessary) to see the small printed text THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA on Benjamin Franklin’s jacket collar, USA 100 around the blank space containing the portrait watermark, ONE HUNDRED USA along the golden quill, and small 100s in the note borders. \n </string>

The thread is imprinted with the text USA 50 and a small flag in an alternating pattern and is visible from both sides of the note. The thread glows yellow when illuminated by ultraviolet light. \n  \n Raised Printing \n Move your finger along the note’s surface to feel the raised printing, which gives genuine Federal Reserve notes their distinctive texture. \n  \n Microprinting \n Look carefully (magnification may be necessary) to see the small printed text FIFTY, USA, and 50 inside two of the blue stars to the left of the portrait, FIFTY repeated within both side borders of the note, and THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA In President Grant’s collar. \n  \n </string>
